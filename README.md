# Walmart-Sales-Data-Analysis-Business-Insights
📘 Overview

This project analyzes the Walmart Sales dataset to uncover key business insights using Python and MySQL Workbench.
It involves data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) in Python, followed by transferring the cleaned dataset into MySQL for SQL-based analysis to answer 10 key business questions related to sales performance, customer behavior, and product categories.

⚙️ Project Workflow

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing – Handled missing values, standardized column names, and formatted data types using Pandas & NumPy.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Visualized sales patterns, ratings, and category-wise performance using Matplotlib & Seaborn.

Database Integration – Connected Jupyter Notebook to MySQL Workbench using SQLAlchemy and PyMySQL.

SQL Analysis – Wrote and executed 10 business queries to derive insights on branch performance, customer trends, and profitability.
